# Description

Cybot is an artificial intelligence-powered cyber security and anti-fraud detection system that detects threats in real time. The Cybot program uses a series of risk algorithms that sift through data and identify threats before they become problematic. One of the key features of the Cybot program is its ability to learn from past experiences and use that knowledge to better predict future security risks. This allows the system to recognize patterns and apply them to new situations.

The Cybot software system is designed to handle massive amounts of data, which allows it to make real time decisions about potential cyber attacks. The program automatically analyzes billions of pieces of data every second, which means that it is able to detect threats quickly and efficiently. Even more impressive is the fact that the Cybot software system can identify potential threats even when it has not previously encountered them before. In other words, even if a hacker has never launched an attack on the site before, there is a high probability that the Cybot software will be able to detect the threat based on similar attacks made on other sites.

Cybot's software does not only protect businesses from attacks, it also helps them improve their own performance. It works by identifying areas where companies can increase their security protocols and by showcasing ways in which they can. 

So far, Cybot has been used by numerous companies as well as government agencies like the FBI and NSA. As a B2B startup, we're based in Indonesia, but we're hoping to expand soon into the AI works by collecting information about the user's device, their browsing history, their social media activity, their search history, etc., and then runs this data through its proprietary algorithm to identify patterns indicative of cyber threats. It then immediately takes action in order to protect the user's online presence. This process happens entirely in the background without any human intervention or interaction with the user.
